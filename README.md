# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Yelp-Reviews

## Problem setup

In this data analysis challenge, we are interested in developing such an automatic sentiment classification system that relies on machine learning techniques to learn from a large set of product reviews provided by Yelp. The levels of polarity of opinion we consider include strong negative, weak negative, neutral, weak positive, and strong positive. For example, “Website says open, Google says open, Yelp says open on Sundays. Our delivery was cancelled suddenly and no one is answering the phone. Shame” gives us a strong negative sentiment, whereas the sentiment of “They have great food & definitely excellent service. Tried their mochi mango flavored and it s definitely delis” is likely to be strong positive.

The aim of this challenge is to develop a sentiment classifier that can assign a large set of product reviews to the five levels of polarity of opinion as accurately as possible. It is a multi-class classification task, where each product review is labeled with one of the five sentiment labels, which are strong negative, weak negative, neutral, weak positive, and strong positive
